# ML-API-Advanced
This repository has the goal to test ML.NET for several use cases and was created to train models for a [self-organizing production](https://github.com/Krockema/ng-erp-4.0). It is also partly used for Projekt Documentatiosn and sharing of related code or scripts.
Actual the program allows to build a model with the best possible trainer based on the input data with the use of [AutoML by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml).


The program is inspired by the [ML.NET Examples](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples) especially https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/predict-prices-with-model-builder and https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/tree/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/Forecasting-Sales.
